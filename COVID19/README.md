Wanted to check out the claim the US was tracking 11 days behind Italy. Ended up down a rabbit hole. 

While I didn't present that result here, the basic idea is that yes, in sheer number of deaths we are trending similarly.
However, this does not take into account deaths per 1 million population, where the US is doing much better. This led to the country comparisons showcased here.

The initial graphs show the curve shape (since all we hear about is "flattening" the curve"), while the other two graphs were really just trying
to compare numbers at the same scale.
